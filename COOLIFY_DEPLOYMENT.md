# Coolify Deployment Guide for ComfyUI + SwarmUI

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying your ComfyUI + SwarmUI Docker setup using Coolify.

## Prerequisites

- Coolify instance running and accessible
- GitHub repository with the Dockerfile (already completed)
- Access to your home server's file system for volume mapping

## Step 1: Access Coolify

1. Open a web browser and navigate to your Coolify installation URL
2. Log in to your Coolify dashboard

## Step 2: Create a New Project

1. In the Coolify dashboard, click "New Project"
2. Give your project a name (e.g., "ComfyUI-SwarmUI")
3. Add a description (optional)
4. Click "Create Project"

## Step 3: Add a New Resource

1. Inside your newly created project, click "New Resource"
2. Select "Public Repository" from the Git-based options
3. Configure the resource with the following settings:

### Basic Configuration
- **Git Repository**: `https://github.com/gordo-v1su4/comfyui-swarmui-backends.git`
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Build Pack**: Select "Dockerfile"
- **Port**: `8188` (ComfyUI default port)

### Advanced Configuration

#### Environment Variables
Add the following environment variables:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
HF_HOME=/workspace/huggingface
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
```

#### Volume Mappings
Configure the following volume mappings to persist your data:

| Container Path | Host Path | Description |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| `/workspace/ComfyUI/models` | `/home/user/comfyui_models` | ComfyUI model files |
| `/workspace/ComfyUI/output` | `/home/user/comfyui_output` | Generated images |
| `/workspace/SwarmUI/Models` | `/home/user/swarmui_models` | SwarmUI model files |
| `/workspace/logs` | `/home/user/comfyui_logs` | Application logs |
| `/workspace/configs` | `/home/user/comfyui_configs` | Configuration files |

#### Resource Limits (Optional)
- **Memory**: 8GB minimum (16GB+ recommended)
- **CPU**: 4 cores minimum
- **GPU**: Enable GPU access if available

## Step 4: Deploy the Application

1. Review all your configuration settings
2. Click the "Deploy" button
3. Monitor the build process in the logs
4. Wait for the deployment to complete

## Step 5: Access Your Applications

Once deployed successfully, you can access:

- **ComfyUI**: `http://your-coolify-domain:8188`
- **SwarmUI**: `http://your-coolify-domain:7860`

## Step 6: Configure SwarmUI with ComfyUI Backend

1. Access SwarmUI through your browser
2. Navigate to "Server" â†’ "Backends" tab
3. Click "Add Backend"
4. Configure the backend with these settings:

### Backend Configuration
- **Type**: `ComfyUI Self-Starting`
- **Name**: `ComfyUI Local`
- **StartScript**: `/workspace/ComfyUI/main.py`
- **ExtraArgs**: `--listen 0.0.0.0 --port 8188 --use-sage-attention --gpu-only`
- **Working Directory**: `/workspace/ComfyUI`

### Performance Optimization Arguments
You can add these arguments to the ExtraArgs field for better performance:
```
--use-sage-attention --gpu-only --disable-xformers --disable-opt-split-attention
```

## Step 7: Download and Install Models

### Option 1: Using the Unified Model Downloader (Recommended)

1. Download the unified model downloader application
2. Run it on your local machine
3. Download the models you need
4. Transfer the models to your server's mapped volume directories:
   - ComfyUI models: `/home/user/comfyui_models`
   - SwarmUI models: `/home/user/swarmui_models`

### Option 2: Manual Model Installation

1. Download models manually from Hugging Face or other sources
2. Place them in the appropriate directories on your server
3. Ensure proper file permissions

## Step 8: Verify Installation

1. **Test ComfyUI**:
   - Load a model in ComfyUI
   - Create a simple workflow
   - Generate an image to verify everything works

2. **Test SwarmUI**:
   - Connect to the ComfyUI backend
   - Test the connection
   - Try running a simple workflow

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures
- Check the build logs in Coolify
- Ensure all dependencies are properly specified in the Dockerfile
- Verify the repository URL is correct

#### Port Conflicts
- Ensure ports 8188 and 7860 are not already in use
- Modify port mappings if necessary

#### GPU Issues
- Verify GPU access is enabled in Coolify
- Check that NVIDIA Container Toolkit is installed on the host
- Ensure CUDA drivers are up to date

#### Model Loading Issues
- Verify model files are in the correct directories
- Check file permissions
- Ensure models are compatible with your ComfyUI version

### Logs and Debugging

1. **View Application Logs**:
   - Access logs through Coolify dashboard
   - Check the `/home/user/comfyui_logs` directory

2. **Container Logs**:
   - Use `docker logs <container-name>` on the host
   - Check Coolify's built-in log viewer

## Performance Optimization

### GPU Optimization
- Enable GPU access in Coolify
- Use performance arguments in SwarmUI backend configuration
- Monitor GPU memory usage

### Memory Optimization
- Increase container memory limits if needed
- Use smaller batch sizes in workflows
- Close unused browser tabs

### Storage Optimization
- Regularly clean up generated images
- Use efficient model formats
- Consider using model merging for space savings

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates
1. Monitor for updates to ComfyUI and SwarmUI
2. Update your Dockerfile as needed
3. Redeploy through Coolify

### Backup Strategy
1. Regularly backup your model directories
2. Export important workflows from ComfyUI
3. Backup configuration files

### Monitoring
1. Monitor resource usage through Coolify
2. Check application logs regularly
3. Monitor disk space usage

## Security Considerations

1. **Network Security**:
   - Use HTTPS if exposing to the internet
   - Configure firewall rules appropriately
   - Consider using a reverse proxy

2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement authentication if needed
   - Restrict access to sensitive directories
   - Monitor access logs

3. **Data Protection**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data
   - Regular backups
   - Secure model storage

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review ComfyUI and SwarmUI documentation
3. Check Coolify documentation
4. Open an issue in the GitHub repository
